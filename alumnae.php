                    <p>Delta Gamma’s Official Web Site provides detailed information and resources for Delta Gamma Alumnae, including information regarding membership, alumnae groups and contacts. Click <a href="https://www.deltagamma.org/our-membership/alumnae">here</a> to visit the Anchors Online- Alumnae.</p>
                    <p>Delta Gamma’s opportunities for involvement and participation are unique. Every initiated member is eligible for membership in any of the 225 alumnae groups when she leaves college, wherever she may live. In an alumnae group, an Delta Gamma alumna could find a group of friends in a new city, a fantastic networking connection for her career, or an exciting service project. Alumnae dues keep the Fraternity operating in a healthy balance, so that all members can reap the benefits of membership.</p>
                    <p>Among the most satisfying alumnae privileges is mentoring collegiate members, serving as advisers, assisting with recruitment, being a house corporation member and interacting at special occasions, all of which aid the collegiate members and strengthens the chapter.</p>

                <h4>founder's day</h4>
                <p>Founder’s Day celebrations, member reunions and anniversary celebrations for collegiate and alumnae chapters bring alumnae together. Typically, chapters celebrating 25th, 50th and 75th anniversaries have many decades of alumnae represented, thus collegiate members become acquainted with women of all ages, emphasizing that Delta Gamma is truly for a lifetime.</p>
