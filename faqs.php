            <h6>Are you active with Social Media?</h6>
            <p>YES! Please get to know our sisters and our involvement on campus through our Instagram and Facebook! To learn more about Delta Gamma Fraternity please visit <a href="deltagamma.org">deltagamma.org</a>.</p>
            <h6>What kind of women does Delta Gamma pledge?</h6>
            <p>In Delta Gamma, we pride ourselves on being individuals. Through our diversity of personalities and interests, we are able to strengthen our bonds of sisterhood, encourage each other to grow and develop our own identity, and be a part of something bigger than ourselves. Our members are looking for women who embody the qualities and values that we ourselves hold dear, such as:
                <li>Lifelong commitment to Delta Gamma</li>
                <li>Desire to partake in service to help others</li>
                <li>Achieving full academic potential</li>
                <li>Participation and/or eagerness to partake in leadership positions, activities, athletics, and talents</li>
                <li>Strong moral character</li></p>
            <h6>Who is a Delta Gamma legacy?</h6>
            <p>The term "legacy" is used to describe a potential new member who is a sister, daughter, granddaughter, or great-granddaughter of a member of Delta Gamma. The Fraternity also recognizes a stepsister, stepdaughter, step granddaughter, or step-great-granddaughter as a legacy. The sister, mother, -grandmother, or -great-grandmother of a legacy (or step-sister, -mother, -grandmother, or -great-grandmother) of the potential new member is encouraged to write and send a Delta Gamma Sponsor Form for their potential new member.</p>
            <p>Legacies are considered to have a special understanding of Fraternity membership and an appreciation for the values of the organization because they have grown up in a Delta Gamma environment. Delta Gamma asks chapters to give special consideration to sponsored candidates for membership, and Fraternity policy requires that special consideration be given to legacies.</p>
            <h6>Are all new members of Delta Gamma guaranteed a spot to live-in the chapter house?</h6>
            <p>Yes, all new members are guaranteed a spot to live-in the house during their first full academic year as a member of Delta Gamma. Typically, women will live-in during their sophomore year. However, if you are a transfer student, you can live-in during your junior or senior year. Living in the house is an incredible, once in a lifetime experience that allows all of our members to get to know each other and stay involved within the chapter. It is one of the best experiences you will have at Cornell!</p>
            <p>Delta Gamma is unique because our home is large enough to fit ALL new members. There is no lottery to get a room in the house—you are guaranteed housing!</p>
            <h4>tips</h4>
            <h5>It is common to have pre-recruitment jitters! Sometimes potential new members may feel a bit intimidated by the speed of the recruitment process and meeting so many people in such a short period of time. If this sounds familiar, we want to assure you that there is nothing to fear! Here are some tips to help ease your nerves about recruitment week.</h5>
            <h6>1. Give it a try!</h6>
            <p>Even if you don’t know if the Greek experience is for you… try it! Going through the recruitment process is a great way to meet new people and make connections with other women on Cornell’s campus-- even if you ultimately decide that joining a house is not for you, you will have grown from the experience.</p>
            <h6>2. Keep an open mind!</h6>
            <p>It might be difficult to dismiss the stereotypes that you have heard about the different chapters prior to recruitment. However, walk into each house with an open mind so that you can form your own opinion about each chapter, about the Greek community in general, and about which house feels like the right fit for you! </p>
            <h6>3. Get to know the chapters!</h6>
            <p>The best way to get to know the chapters during recruitment week is to ask questions! This will allow you to make the best use of your time at each house so that you can get a better idea about what each chapter is like. Women in each house will be eager to answer any questions you might have!</p>
            <h6>4. Have fun!</h6>
            <p>This may seem silly but it’s important! Trust in yourself and trust in the recruitment process—let us get to know YOU! Everyone will end up in the house that best suits them!</p>
            <h6>5. Be yourself!</h6>
            <p>Probably the best advice that we can give is that during recruitment week you must be true to yourself! When making your final decision, choose a chapter that is not only reflective of who you are, but will challenge you to become the person that you want to be. You want to pick the chapter where you feel the most comfortable and at home, even if your friends prefer other chapters. Each woman should end up in the chapter that fits them best—you will maintain your other friendships regardless!</p>
