                <p>Dear Potential New Members,</p>
                <p>First and foremost, congratulations on your acceptance to Cornell! As Vice Presidents of Membership, we speak on behalf of the entire Chi chapter of Delta Gamma when we say that we cannot wait to meet all of you during the fall semester and recruitment week in January! Recruitment is Delta Gamma's most anticipated event of the year and we are so excited to welcome you into our home and into the Cornell community.</p>
                <p>If you are nervous about the recruitment process, or are hesitant as to whether or not Greek life is for you, let us assure you that there is no need to be! We sincerely encourage any woman interested in taking part in Cornell’s recruitment process to do so. Recruitment is an amazing experience where you are given the opportunity to meet hundreds of unique and incredible Panhellenic women—many of whom will become your friends (and sisters) for a lifetime!</p>
                <p>It is through this recruitment process that we have each found our perfect fit in Delta Gamma. Our passionate, enthusiastic, and dynamic sisterhood attracts women from around the world and we are all proud to call 117 Triphammer Road our home away from home. Delta Gamma provides our members countless opportunities to take on leadership roles, network with our extensive alumni base, and take part in philanthropic events that benefit our national philanthropy, Service for Sight. We take pride in the fact that each sister is brilliantly accomplished and astoundingly unique in her own way. However, as a chapter, we continue to promote the highest ideals of sisterhood to maximize our potential and develop our character, while making genuine friends and unforgettable memories in the process!</p>
                <p>We invite all of our friends, family, alumni, and potential new members to continue exploring Chi’s website, to become familiar with our recruitment process, and to learn more about what our chapter is involved in and what we have accomplished within the Cornell community and beyond.</p>
                <p>Your interest in Delta Gamma and the recruitment process makes each of us so excited to share with you the extraordinary legacy that has been built here at Chi! You have an exciting journey ahead of you and we cannot wait to meet you in January! Enjoy the rest of your semester!</p>
                <p>Wishing you all the best, <br>
                    Sarah Cassidy and Carli Grims <br>
